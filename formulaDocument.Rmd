Sigh convection in $R^3$:  
x into and out of page, y going laterally, and z going up and down.

Distance in $R^3$ - 3d pythagoras:
$$d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2-(y_2-y_1)^2-(z_2-z_1)^2}$$
$sqrt(x)$


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
